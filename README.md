## Introduction

Managing dependencies in Python can often feel like navigating a minefield. With multiple projects requiring different versions of libraries, developers frequently encounter issues that can slow down progress. IX-py aims to solve these problems with a modern approach to Python project management. 

This tool serves as an alternative to traditional methods like `virtualenv` and `pip-tools`. It is designed for elite developers, data scientists, AI teams, and secure DevOps environments. By using IX-py, you can focus on building your applications rather than wrestling with dependency conflicts.

## Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: IX-py has no external dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate into your workflow.
- **Project Isolation**: Each project runs in its own isolated environment, ensuring that dependencies do not interfere with one another.
- **Lightweight CLI**: The command-line interface is designed to be user-friendly and efficient.
- **Best Practices**: Supports `pyproject.toml`, aligning with modern Python packaging standards.
- **Reproducible Builds**: Easily reproduce builds across different environments.
- **Secure Packaging**: Focus on security by isolating environments and managing dependencies effectively.

## Installation

To get started with IX-py, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Neengen/IX-py.git
   cd IX-py
   ```

2. **Install IX-py**:
   You can install IX-py using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Run the following command to ensure IX-py is installed correctly:
   ```bash
   ix --version
   ```

## Usage

Using IX-py is straightforward. Here are some common commands to get you started:

### Create a New Project

To create a new project, use the following command:

```bash
ix create my_project
```

This will set up a new project with an isolated environment.

### Activate the Project Environment

To activate your project environment, run:

```bash
ix activate my_project
```

### Install Dependencies

To install dependencies for your project, use:

```bash
ix install requests numpy
```

### Run Your Application

You can run your Python application within the isolated environment:

```bash
ix run my_script.py
```

## Project Structure

A typical IX-py project will look like this:

```
my_project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ .ix/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ environment/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ my_script.py
```

- **.ix/**: Contains environment-specific files.
- **pyproject.toml**: Configuration file for your project.
- **README.md**: Documentation for your project.
- **my_script.py**: Your main application script.

## Best Practices

To make the most out of IX-py, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use `pyproject.toml`**: Always define your dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file. This keeps your project organized and in line with modern Python practices.

2. **Isolate Projects**: Always create a new environment for each project. This prevents conflicts between different projects.

3. **Regular Updates**: Keep your dependencies updated to benefit from the latest features and security patches.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation in your README file to help others understand your project.

5. **Testing**: Regularly test your project in its isolated environment to catch any issues early.
